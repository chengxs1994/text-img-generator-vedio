Short history of Apple Company
Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, in Cupertino, California. The company initially started as a partnership between Jobs and Wozniak, who were working out of Jobs' garage.

Their first product was the Apple I, a computer kit that was sold without a keyboard or a monitor. It was mostly targeted at hobbyists and was hand-built by Wozniak. However, it gained attention and interest from the Homebrew Computer Club, which helped the company raise capital for their next product.

The Apple II, released in April 1977, was a major success for the company. It was the first personal computer to feature color graphics and a microprocessor-controlled motherboard. The Apple II became popular in the education sector and played a significant role in shaping the personal computer industry.

In the 1980s, Apple faced competition from IBM and Microsoft, but it managed to release the Macintosh in The Macintosh revolutionized the personal computer industry with its graphical user interface and mouse, making computers more user-friendly.
